# Triproc

I was asked to demonstrate my coding abilility by solving the following problem:

	The file contains a list of triangles. One point per line, three consecutive lines form a triangle. It's a straightforward list, no tristripping or anything like that. The task is to write a program that would remove any duplicate and degenerate triangles from this list. It can be written in any language.


This is my solution. Note that I did implement tristriping, mistakenly. This was build with Xcode 4.x.
